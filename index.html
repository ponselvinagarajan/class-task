	//3.Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called "BankAccount" with properties for account number and balance. Include methods to deposit and withdraw money from the account. Create some instances of the "BankAccount" class, deposit some money, and withdraw a portion of it.

    //4.Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Shape' with a method to calculate the area. Create two subclasses, 'Circle' and 'Triangle', that inherit from the 'Shape' class and override the area calculation method. Create an instance of the 'Circle' class and calculate its area. Similarly, do the same for the 'Triangle' class.

	//5.Write a JavaScript program that creates a class called 'Employee' with properties for name and salary. Include a method to calculate annual salary. Create a subclass called 'Manager' that inherits from the 'Employee' class and adds an additional property for department. Override the annual salary calculation method to include bonuses for managers. Create two instances of the 'Manager' class and calculate their annual salary.

	class Employee{
	    constructor(name,salary){

	console.log(salary2);
    	
	//6.Write a JavaScript program that creates a class `Book` with properties for title, author, and publication year. Include a method to display book details. Create a subclass called 'Ebook' that inherits from the 'Book' class and includes an additional property for book price. Override the display method to include the book price. Create an instance of the 'Ebook' class and display its details.
